In a tournament, players, dealers, and the floor staff are entitled to a reasonable estimation of opponentsâ€™ chip stacks. A player may request a more precise count only if facing an all-in bet and it is their turn to act. If there is a discrepancy, the tournament director (TD) or dealer will assist in providing an accurate count.
