In the event of a misdeal in a tournament, the hand is re-dealt as an exact replay, meaning the button does not move, no new players are seated, and the limits remain the same. Cards are dealt to players who were initially dealt in but not at their seats, allowing them to participate in the re-deal. Players on penalty will receive cards, but their hands are killed, and the original deal and re-deal count as one hand for such players.
