When a player goes all-in during a tournament, all their downcards must be turned face up once all betting action by the other players in the hand is complete, as per Rule 16. This means that if further betting is possible by other players with remaining chips, the cards are not turned up until that action is resolved. Once no further betting is possible, all hands, both in the main and side pots, must be tabled and are considered live.
