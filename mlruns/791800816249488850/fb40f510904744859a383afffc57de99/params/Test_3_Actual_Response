If a player acts out of turn (OOT), the action will be backed up to the correct player in order. The OOT action is binding if the action to the OOT player does not change; however, if the action changes, the OOT player can choose their action again (call, raise, or fold). An OOT fold is always binding, and penalties may apply to the player who acted out of turn.
