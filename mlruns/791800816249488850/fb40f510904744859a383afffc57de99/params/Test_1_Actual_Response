In a tournament, the minimum bet or raise must be at least equal to the size of the big blind. After the initial bet or raise, any subsequent raise must be at least the size of the largest previous bet or raise of the current betting round. The exception is an all-in bet that is less than the required raise amount; this will be considered a call or raise as appropriate based on the player's remaining chips.
